        <h1>My first website</h1>
        <h2>Day 1</h2>
        <h3>Text</h3>
        This is the first website text!
        __There was supposed to be an enter there
        __and there but I do not know how to make one
        __as I learn to code my writing will have more shape and look more appealing
        <h3>Paragraphs and Headings</h3>
        <p>I just figured out how to make paragraphs! and separate 
            out lines and such with the "p" element
            <br>
            <br>
            I'll also take some space to demonstrate heading sizes</p>
        <h1 class="heading-ex">Heading 1</h1>
        <h2 class="heading-ex">Heading 2</h2>
        <h3 class="heading-ex">Heading 3</h3>
        <h4 class="heading-ex">Heading 4</h4>
        <h5 class="heading-ex">Heading 5</h5>
        <h6 class="heading-ex">Heading 6</h6>
        <p>These are all six headings available in html</p>
        <h3>Bolds, Italicizes, and More!?</h3>
        <p>There are also text elements that allow you to make text 
            <strong>bolded</strong> and <em>italicized</em> 
            <br>
            <br>
            These bolded and italicized elements can be used just as endlessly as other
            elements. One defining factor of "bolding" text is that, when using the 
            "strong" tag, it marks that text as important.
            <br>
            <br>
            See code for explanation of html comments!
        <!-- This tag is used to create comments on your code. These comments cannot be 
        see on the website -->
        <!-- The tags on either side of the text create the html comment -->
        <!-- By hitting "Ctrl + /" you can quickly make a comment or turn a line of code 
            into a comment!-->
            <br>
            <br>
            Try turning this line of code into a comment! Simply highlight it an press 
            "Ctrl + /"
            <br>
            <br>
            Apparently... typing out "lorem" and then hitting enter will automatically
            type out what is known as "Lorem Ipsum" text. Also known as filler.
            <br>
            <br>
            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Fugiat magni voluptates

            temporibus ratione qui perferendis laborum enim sint.
            <br>
            <br>
            Boom! Just like that!</p>
        <h2>Day 2</h2>
        <p>Alright now we're getting into lists. First we've got unordered lists with a "ul"
            command and an "li" command
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Item 1</li>
            <li>Item 2</li>
            <li>Item 3</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I don't really get why lists have to look like that in code. I can kinda of get 
            it, but it's only because paragraphs are nested by bodies like lists are. They're
            both redundant but lists just feel worse.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>This is an</li>
            <li>ordered list</li>
            <li>it uses the "ol" element</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>"Entry" 3</h2>
        <p>It has been a week since my last entry which is why I am deciding to change the 
            names of entries from "Day" to "Entry". Since my last entry I have learned more
            code from apps I downloaded on my phone. I downloaded them because I have
            recently had less time to work on my computer. These apps have taught me more
            about html and css and as a result I will be cleaning up my code. Below there 
            are images of the before and after.
        </p>
        <h4>Before Edits:</h4>
        <img class="Screenshot" src="images/FirstBefore.jpg" alt="First Before">
        <img class="Screenshot" src="images/SecondBefore.png" alt="Second Before">
        <img class="Screenshot" src="images/ThirdBefore.png" alt="Third Before">
        <h4>After Edits:</h4>
        <img class="Screenshot" src="images/FirstAfter.png" alt="First After">
        <img class="Screenshot" src="images/SecondAfter.png" alt="Second After">
        <img class="Screenshot" src="images/ThirdAfter.png" alt="Third After">
        <img class="Screenshot" src="images/FourthAfter.png" alt="Style Sheet">
        <h2>Entry 4</h2>
        <p>We have finished the making our changes. While they have been minimal, I do 
            believe that the code looks reasonably cleaner. I also added a style sheet
            that can pretty up the code. I now realize the lack of condensed code for 
            the "top-box" "sides-box" and "bottom-box" classes. Without retaking
            screenshots and proving it, I have changed all three of those to "heading-ex".
        </p>
        <p>Currently, I have put in little work into coding throughout the past week. I 
            hope to get back into the routine of learning from The Odin Project (TOP), 
            but for now I am going to take it slow as school is building up.
